## 1. Sign in to Apollo Studio

If you don‚Äôt have an Apollo Studio account, create one with the following steps:

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and click **Create an account**.

    _You can sign up with either your GitHub identity or a username and password._

2. Complete the signup flow, which includes:

    * Creating an organization that you can invite teammates to

    * [Selecting a plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) for your organization (the Free plan is always free, and the Team plan provides a free trial of paid features)

## 2. Create a graph in Studio

In Studio, each **graph** corresponds to a data graph and its associated GraphQL schema.

1. Visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) again. Now that you have an account, this opens Studio.

    _The list of organizations you belong to appears in the left column._

2. Select the organization that you want to add your graph to. Then, click **New Graph** in the upper right.

3. Specify a name for your graph and click **Next**.

    * A graph's name must be globally unique across all of Studio. We recommend using a consistent prefix across all of your organization's graphs.

4. Studio displays instructions for registering your schema, which is also covered in a later step. 

## 3. Install the new Rover CLI

**Rover** is the helpful new CLI for managing your Apollo Studio graphs üê∂

Install it with your preferred method on <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/#installation-methods" target="_blank">this page</a>.

### Authenticate Rover with Apollo Studio

After you install Rover, you need to authenticate it with Apollo Studio. To do this, you need an **API key**.

#### Obtain an API key

All Rover commands that communicate with [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) require an API key to do so. Studio supports two types of API keys: **personal API keys** and **graph API keys**.

* **On your local development machine,** use a personal API key.
* **In shared environments like CI,** use a graph API key.

> [Learn how to obtain an API key](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/)

#### Provide the API key to Rover

Run the following command:

```shell
rover config auth
```

Provide your API key to the command when prompted.


## 4. Register your subgraphs

Apollo Federation is all about composing multiple GraphQL services (**subgraphs**) into a single federated graph (or **supergraph**):

```mermaid
graph BT;
  gateway(["Supergraph (A + B + C)"]);
  serviceA[Subgraph A];
  serviceB[Subgraph B];
  serviceC[Subgraph C];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
```

To enable managed federation with Apollo, you register _each_ of your subgraph schemas. You can use Rover's `subgraph publish` command to do this:

```
rover subgraph publish <GRAPH_REF> \
  --profile <profile-name> \
  --routing-url <routing-url> \
  --schema <schema> \
  --name <subgraph>
```

Repeat this for each subgraph you want to include in your supergraph.

[See the docs for `subgraph publish`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/subgraphs/#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-apollo-studio)

## 5. Configure and deploy your gateway
**TODO: we need to consolidate the substeps here.**

First, let's install the necessary packages:

```shell
npm install @apollo/gateway apollo-server graphql
```

The `@apollo/gateway` package includes the [`ApolloGateway` class](/api/apollo-gateway/). To configure Apollo Server to act as a gateway, you pass an instance of `ApolloGateway` to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// Initialize an ApolloGateway instance and pass it an array of
// your implementing service names and URLs
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'accounts', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    // Define additional services here
  ],
});

// Pass the ApolloGateway to the ApolloServer constructor
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,

  // Disable subscriptions (not currently supported with ApolloGateway)
  subscriptions: false,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`üöÄ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

In the above example, we provide the `serviceList` configuration option to the `ApolloGateway` constructor. This array specifies a `name` and `url` for each of our implementing services. You can specify any string value for `name`, which is used primarily for query planner output, error messages, and logging.

> In production, we recommend running the gateway in a **managed mode** with Apollo Studio, which relies on static files rather than introspection. For details, see [Setting up managed federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/managed-federation/setup/).

On startup, the gateway fetches each implementing service's schema from its `url` and composes those schemas into a single federated data graph. It then begins accepting incoming requests and creates query plans for them that execute across one or more services.

> If there are any composition errors, the `new ApolloServer` call throws an exception
> with a list of [validation errors](/errors/).


**TODO: reconcile the gateway setup (above) w/ managed federation setup docs (below) into a from-scratch setup of a gateway with managed federation.**

### Modify the gateway

> This section assumes you are using Apollo Server with the `@apollo/gateway` library as your gateway.

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ Apollo Studio, the constructor of your `ApolloGateway` instance probably includes a `serviceList` option, like this:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'Products', url: 'http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/' },
    // Additional services defined here
  ],
});
```

This option specifies the name and URL for each of your graph's implementing services. With managed federation, this information is no longer hardcoded in the gateway's constructor! Instead, the gateway regularly polls Apollo for this information. This enables you to add and remove implementing services from your graph _without_ needing to restart your gateway.

Remove the `serviceList` argument from your `ApolloGateway` constructor entirely:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway();
```

### Connect the gateway to Studio

Like your implementing services, your gateway uses an API key to identify itself to Studio.

> **API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and click the graph you want to obtain an API key for.

2. **If a "Publish your Schema" dialog appears**, select the **From Apollo Server** tab. Copy the value that appears after `APOLLO_KEY=` in the instructions (it begins with `service:`), and you're all set.

    **Otherwise**, proceed to the next step.

2. Open your graph's Settings page and scroll down to the API Keys section. Either copy an existing key or click **Create New Key**.

3. Optionally click the `‚Ä¶` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Production`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

4. Copy the key's value.

Provide your API key to your gateway by setting it as the value of the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable (`ENGINE_API_KEY` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) in your gateway's environment. Apollo Server will automatically read this environment variable on startup.

Note that if you specify the API key in a `.env` file, the gateway does _not_ automatically read this file. Use a library such as [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

> When running your gateway in an environment where outbound traffic to the internet is restricted, consult the [directions for configuring a proxy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/proxy-configuration/) within Apollo Server.

### Deploy the modified gateway

You can now deploy your modified gateway to begin fetching your federated schema from Studio instead of directly from your services.

On startup, your gateway will use its API key to access its federation config from Google Cloud Storage. After it completes schema composition based on the config, the gateway can begin executing operations across your implementing services.


## Step 6: Report metrics and operations from your subgraph servers.

To take advantage of Studio‚Äôs observability and delivery capabilities you must enable request tracing.

Apollo Studio can ingest operation **traces** from your GraphQL server to provide performance metrics for your data graph. A trace corresponds to the execution of a single GraphQL operation, including a breakdown of the timing and error information for each field that's resolved as part of the operation.

Trace reporting enables you to visualize:

* Which operations are being executed
* Which clients are executing which operations
* Which parts of the schema are used most
* Which of your resolvers in the server are acting as bottlenecks

### Pushing traces from Apollo Server

Apollo Server has built-in support for pushing traces to Apollo Studio. To set it up, you provide it a **graph API key** from Studio.

> **API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and click the graph you want to obtain an API key for.

2. **If a "Publish your Schema" dialog appears**, select the **From Apollo Server** tab. Copy the value that appears after `APOLLO_KEY=` in the instructions (it begins with `service:`), and you're all set.

    **Otherwise**, proceed to the next step.

2. Open your graph's Settings page and scroll down to the API Keys section. Either copy an existing key or click **Create New Key**.

3. Optionally click the `‚Ä¶` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Production`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

4. Copy the key's value.

After you obtain a graph API key, assign it to the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable (`ENGINE_API_KEY` prior to version 2.13.0 of Apollo Server) in your production server's environment.

> Consult your production environment's documentation to learn how to set its environment variables.

Now the next time you start your production server, it will automatically begin pushing trace data to Studio:

<img src="./img//metrics.jpg" class="screenshot" alt="Apollo Studio metrics view"></img>

You can also push trace data from environments besides production, such as a staging or beta server. To keep this data separate from your production data, learn how to [create variants of your graph](./org/graphs/#managing-variants).

For advanced configuration options, see [Metrics and logging](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/metrics/).

## Step 7: Test your graph with Explorer!
The Apollo Studio Explorer is a powerful web IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8b0Bda_TIw

[*See more: Get started with Explorer*](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/)

## Step 8: Test a change against actual traffic with Checks!

Now that your graph is live and serving traffic, you want to be careful about any changes you make - you don‚Äôt want to make a breaking change! This is why we offer Operation Checks.

> Schema checks require a [paid plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing).

Before you [publish subgraph schema changes to Apollo Studio](#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-apollo-studio), you can [check those changes](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/) to confirm that you aren't introducing breaking changes to your application clients.

To do so, you can run the `subgraph check` command:


```shell
# using a schema file
rover subgraph check my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql --name accounts

# using piped input to stdin
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 \
  | rover subgraph check my-graph@my-variant \
  --schema - --name accounts
```

As shown, arguments and options are similar to [`subgraph publish`](#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-apollo-studio).

## Step 9: Set up CI/CD integration

You can use Rover in any CI/CD environment that uses a Rover-supported operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows). Most commonly, this is to run [schema checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/) with [`rover graph check`](./graphs/#checking-schema-changes) or [`rover subgraph check`](./subgraphs/#checking-subgraph-schema-changes).

Rover can be installed like many other CLI tools, but the installation method varies depending on which provider you're using. We've included instructions for two of the most common CI/CD providers, [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).


> If you're using Rover with a CI/CD provider not listed here, we'd love for you to share the steps by opening an [issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/new/choose) or [pull request](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/compare)!

### CircleCI 

#### Linux jobs using the `curl` installer

Normally, when installing, Rover adds the path of its executable to your `$PATH`. CircleCI, however, doesn't use the `$PATH` variable between run `step`s, so if you were to just install Rover and try to run it in the next step, you'd get a `command not found: rover` error.

To fix this, you can modify the `$PATH` and append it to [`$BASH_ENV`](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-shell-command). `$BASH_ENV` is executed at the beginning of each step, allowing any changes added to it to be run across steps. You can add rover to your `$PATH` using `$BASH_ENV` like this:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.rover/bin:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
```

Once installed and the `$BASH_ENV` has been modified, rover should work like normal. Dont forget, since the `rover config auth` command is interactive, you'll need to [auth using an environment variable](./configuring#with-an-environment-variable) in your project settings.

##### Full example

```yaml
# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:15.11.0        
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install
          command: |
            # download and install Rover
            curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apollographql/rover/v0.0.6/installers/binstall/scripts/nix/install.sh | sh
            
            # This allows the PATH changes to persist to the next `run` step
            echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.rover/bin:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
      - checkout
      # after rover is installed, you can run it just like you would locally!
      - run: rover graph check my-graph@prod --schema ./schema.graphql
```

### GitHub Actions

#### Linux/MacOS jobs using the `curl` installer

Normally, when installing, Rover adds the path of its executable to your `$PATH`. Github Actions, however, doesn't use the `$PATH` variable between `step`s, so if you were to just install Rover and try to run it in the next step, you'd get a `command not found: rover` error.

To fix this, you can append Rover's location to the [`$GITHUB_PATH`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-system-path) variable. `$GITHUB_PATH` is similar to your system's `$PATH` variable, and things added to the `$GITHUB_PATH` can be used across multiple steps. You can modify it like this:

```bash
echo "$HOME/.rover/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

Because the `rover config auth` command is interactive, you'll need to [auth using an environment variable](./configuring#with-an-environment-variable) in your project settings. GitHub actions uses [project environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments) to set up secret environment variables. In your action, you choose a `build.environment` by name and set `build.env` variables using the saved secrets.

The following example is full example script, showing how to choose an `apollo` environment, and set an `APOLLO_KEY` variable.


##### Full example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/check.yml

name: Check Schema

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events
on: [push, pull_request]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments
    environment: apollo

    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv
    env:
      APOLLO_KEY: ${{ secrets.APOLLO_KEY }}

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Rover
        run: |
          curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apollographql/rover/v0.0.6/installers/binstall/scripts/nix/install.sh | sh
          
          # Add Rover to the $GITHUB_PATH so it can be used in another step
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-system-path
          echo "$HOME/.rover/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
      - name: Run check against prod
        run: |
          rover graph check my-graph@prod --schema ./test.graphql

```

### Using With `npm`/`npx`

If you're running in a Node.js workflow, it may be easier to just use the NPM distribution of [Rover](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/rover). The advantages of doing this are that you won't need to adjust the PATH at all to run Rover, and it may fit better into your existing workflow.

You can use Rover by adding it to your `package.json` dependencies using [these instructions](./getting-started#npm-installer) and then execute it using npm scripts, similar to other workflows you may already have. If you don't want to install rover as a dependency, you can run Rover with `npx` by using the `-p` flag:

```bash
npx -p @apollo/rover rover graph check my-graph@prod --schema=./schema.graphql
```

Since most commands require you be authenticated, see the above sections for instructions on how to add environment variables for your CI/CD provider.

## 10. Advanced configuration for checks

To configure the behavior of schema checks (such as the time range of past operations to check against), see the [documentation for schema checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/check-configurations/#using-apollo-studio-recommended).
