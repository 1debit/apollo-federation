schema lyrical
...users
...admin

# I expect that @-files will almost always be written in starQL,
# so I'm doing that here. If you wanted to write it in gql with
# directives, you could do this:

## @.gql
#   schema @id(name: "lyrical")
#     @include(schema: "users")
#     @include(schema: "admin") {
#      query: Query
#      mutation: Mutation
#   }
##

# It's a bit pointlessly verbose though.
